<h1>Detection_falling_person</h1>


<h3>Presentation</h3>

With this program, you can detect people who are falling and start an action when it happens<br/>

It uses the algorithm Yolo to detect shape of people and once it detects all the shapes, the shapes of people are passing through an other algorithm<br/>
which I have made and can tell you if those shapes are falling or not<br/>
