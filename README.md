<h1>Fall-detection-with-camera</h1>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

With this program, you can detect people who are falling and start an action when it happens<br/>
You have detection in live on people<br/>

To better detection I had a timer when it exceeds a certain time, it triggers an action ( by default it just rings an alarm ) <br/>
we can see the duration of the fall on the screen's top-left corner<br/>

You can even detect multiple person on the same image and even in live with streaming camera

<h3>What do you need</h3>

<h3>How to use it</h3>



<h3>How it works</h3>

It uses the algorithm Yolo to detect shape of people and once it detects all the shapes, the shapes of people are passing through an other algorithm<br/>
which I have made and can tell you if those shapes are falling or not<br/>

Algorithm:<br/>

I made it for my TIPE which are an exam from Classe Pr√©paratoire to pass some exams<br/>
